# Garbage Collector

Go has a non-generational, non-compacting, concurrent, trie-color mark-and-sweep collector.

Non-compacting means the memory on the heap is not moving. Once an allocation is made on the heap, its address is fixed for the lifetime of that allocation.

## Priorities

Go's garbage collector has 2 priorities:

1. Maximize throughput during collection
2. Minimize resource utilization & latency

Ensuring the STW phases in total not to exceed 100 microseconds for less latency is garbage collector's one of the key priorities.

## Mechanics

Once the garbage collection starts, it runs in 3 different phases.

1. Mark start (stop the world (STW) phase)
2. Marking (Concurrent phase)
3. Mark termination (STW phase)

### Mark Start

When the mark starts, all the go routines are stopped. If the application Go routines get too close to the garbage collector in memory, the write barrier flag gets turned on to prevent data integrity issues. Then the Go routines are turned back on.

The scheduler waits for the Go routines to make a function call for the STW event, and as soon as that happens, it intercedes and stops it (which takes 10~30 microseconds). If some of the Go routines are not making a function call, the STW may take longer than usual. Therefore, we have to ensure our Go routines healthy by enabling them make function calls in reasonable amounts of time.

### Marking

After Mark start phase completes, garbage collector starts running. When the garbage collector runs, it takes 25% of CPU and all the Go routines queued of on that processor would have to go to the remaining processors. There may be times the garbage collector gets Mark Assist from the remaining processors (this would also result in STW on that processor) if it deems that the Go routines wouldn't allow it to finish within the allocated time, or if it notices the Go routines are making heavy allocations on the heap during the garbage collection.

How the marking phase works:

1. Scan the stacks to find pointers pointing to the root values on the heap
2. Paint every value on the heap white and when we find root values, paint them gray and put them in a queue
3. Pull the root values out of the queue and paint them black, then see if they are pointing to any other values on the heap, and paint those values gray and put them in the queue

This is how the garbage collector traverse through the entire heap painting everything from white, gray, to black. After this, all we have would be white (the ones no longer used) and black (those still in use) values. Sweeping happens outside the garbage collection in the allocator.

In order to reduce the amount of time spent on marking, you have to reduce the number of go routines, and reduce the number of values that can allocated at any given time. The Go profiler does let you look at the object counts on the heap.

### Mark Termination

In this phase, all the Go routines are stopped again and the write barrier flag gets turned off. Then Go routines start running again.

## Pacer

Pacer's job is to determine:

- when to start the collection
- how long the collection's going to take
- make sure to start the collection at the very last moment yet to still finish it before we run out of heap space.

It determines how much pressure (how quickly we fill the heap up in between the garbage collections) we're putting on the heap.

The GOGC environmental variable is set at 100%. 100% means if we end up with 2 megabytes of heap in use, then we're going to size the entire heap to 4 megabytes (double the amount in use). This creates 2 megabytes of gap. At the end of every garbage collection, the heap gets resized this way. When we talk about the stress/pressure on the heap, we're talking about how fast we fill up the gap. The quicker it takes to fill up the gap, the more frequent the garbage collector runs. Minimizing the pressure on the heap by reducing the number of values to be scanned on the heap would lead to less number of garbage collections and help speed up the program.
