# Constants

Constants only exist at the compile time and there can be two types of constants:

- Untyped constants
- Typed constants

```go
// Untyped constants are implicitly converted by the compiler which creates some interesting side effects.
const ui = 12345    // kind: integer
const uf = 3.141592 // kind: floating-point with 256 bit precision -- because of it, we can consider kinds to be mathematically exact

// Typed constants still use the constant type system but their is restricted
const ti int = 12345        // type: int
const tf float64 = 3.141592 // type: float64
```

The kind promotion (to a different kind of a type) makes constants powerful by enabling implicit conversions for untyped constants. It is safer as it happens at the compile time.
You still have to make explicit conversions for typed constants.

```go
// answer will be of type float64
var answer = 3 * 0.333 // KindFloat(3) * KindFloat(0.333) -- float will get truncated into 64bit from 256bit
```

You can use iota to create incrementing constants.

```go
const (
    A = iota // 0 : Start at 0
    B = iota // 1 : Increment by 1
    C = iota // 2 : Increment by 1
)

// you can also do it like this
const (
    A2 = iota   // 0
    B2          // 1
    C2          // 2
)

// you can start from somewhere else
const (
    A3 = iota + 1
    B3
    C3
)
```

You can also create a bitmap of constants (time packages often do this).

```go
const (
    Ldate = 1 << iota           //  1 : shift 1 to the left 0.      0000 0001
    Ltime                       //  2 : shift 1 to the left 1.      0000 0010
    Lmicroseconds               //  4 : shift 1 to the left 2.      0000 0100
    Llongfile                   //  8 : shift 1 to the left 3.      0000 1000
    Lshortfile                  // 16 : shift 1 to the left 4.      0001 0000
    LUTC                        // 32 : shift 1 to the left 5.      0010 0000
)
```
