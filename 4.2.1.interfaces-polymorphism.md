# Interfaces

Interface types are not concrete types and they're valueless. They don't define any sort of data, they only define a method set of behavior.

An interface value is a two-word data structure, both of which are pointers. Its first word points to the special table called iTable (a.k.a., interface table) which defines the type of data being stored, and it has a pointer to the implementation of the method for that data. The second pointer points to the copy of the data.
When we call a method against the data that implements the specified interface, then we're going to make an iTable lookup, and identify the type of data being stored, and we call the method implementation against our copy.

```go
import fmt
// reader is an interface that defines the act of reading data.
// this is not a concrete data, but specifies a method
type reader interface {
    read(bytes []byte) (int, error)
}

// file defines a system file
type file struct {
    name string
}

// read implements the reader interface for a file
func (file) read(bytes []byte) (int, error) {
    s := "<rss><channel><title>Going Go Programming</title></channel></rss>"
    copy(bytes, s)

    return len(s), nill
}

// pipe defines a named pipe network connection
type pipe struct {
    name string
}

// read implements the reader interface for a network connection
func (pipe) read(bytes []byte) (int, error) {
    s := `{name: "bill", title: "developer"}`
    copy(bytes, s)

    return len(s), nill
}

// retrieve can read any device and process the data
// the following function takes any type of data that implements reader interface
// it's not asking for data based on what it is, but based on what it can do
// this is when we move from concrete to decoupling world
func retrieve(r reader) error {
    data := make([]byte, 100)

    len, err := r.read(data)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    fmt.Println(string(data[:len]))
    return nill
}

// create two values
data_file := file{"data.json"}
data_pipe := pipe{"cfg_service"}

// call the retrieve function for each concrete type
retrieve(data_file)
retrieve(data_pipe)
```

If we want a collection of different concrete data, we have to do it not based on what it is, but always based on what it does.

```go
// printer interface displays information
type printer interface {
    print()
}

// user struct defines a user in the program
type user struct {
    name string
}

// user implements printer interface via print method
func (u user) print() {
    fmt.Printf("Username: %s\n", u.name)
}

func main() {
    // create value of type user
    u := user{"Bill"}

    // add the value and pointer to the slice of printer interface values
    entities := []printer{
        // store a copy of the user value in the interface value
        u,
        // store a copy of the address of the user value in the interface
        &u,
    }

    // change the name field on the user value
    u.name = "Jane"

    // iterate over the slice of entities and call print against the copied interface values
    // here we use value semantics because interface is a reference type so it's already leveraging pointer semantics behind the scene
    for _, entity := range entities {
        entity.print()
    }
    // loop result (the first iteration prints entities' own copy of u, so the update is not reflected, while the second iteration prints the value )
    // Username: Bill
    // Username: Jane

    // when we store a value, the interface value has its own copy of the value. Changes to the original value won't be seen.
}
```

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism means that you write a certain program and it behaves differently depending on the data it operates on. (Tom Kurtz, inventor of BASIC)
