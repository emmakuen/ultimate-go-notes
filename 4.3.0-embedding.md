# Embedding

You can embed a type inside a type. This is called embedding. Go allows inner type promotion where all the associated fields and methods of the embedded type to promote up to the outer type so that you can use them directly from its outer type. This becomes possible due

```go
// notifier is an interface that defines notification type behavior
type notifier interface {
    notify()
}

type user struct {
    name string
    email string
}

// notify implements notifier interface with the notify method that notifies users of different events
func (u *user) notify() {
    fmt.Printf("Sending user email to %s<%s>\n", u.name, u.email)
}

type admin struct {
    user // embedded type
    level string
}

func main() {
    // create admin user
    // admin also implements the notifier interface thanks to inner type promotion
    super_admin := admin {
        user: user {
            name: "John Smith",
            email: "john@mail.com",
        },
        level: "super",
    }

// we can access inner type's methods directly
super_admin.user.notify() // Sending user email to John Smith<john@mail.com>

// the inter type's method is promoted, so you can also directly call it from the outer type
super_admin.notify() // Sending user email to John Smith<john@mail.com>

// you can also send the super admin user a notification using the sendNotification polymorphic function
// the embedded inner type's implementation of the interface is "promoted" to the outer type
sendNotification(&super_admin) // Sending user email to John Smith<john@mail.com>
}

//
// sendNotification is a polymorphic (behaves differently depending on the data it operates on, takes values not based on what they are, but based on what they do) accepts values that implement the notifier interface and sends notifications
func sendNotification(n notifier) {
    n.notify()
}
```

If the outer type also implements the same method or interface, it overrides those of its inner type so that there's no conflict.

Inner types can have inner types that have inner types, but avoiding that is more desirable in Go due to its inner type promotion feature.
