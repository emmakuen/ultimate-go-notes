# Composition

A good API is not just easy to use but also hard to misuse.

You can always embed, but you cannot decompose big interfaces once they are out there. Keep interfaces small.

Duplication is far cheaper than wrong abstraction.

## Guidelines around declaring types

- Declare types that represent something new or unique
- Validate that a value of any type is created or used on its own
- Embed types to reuse existing behaviors you need to satisfy
- Question types that are an alias or abstraction for an existing type
- Question types whose sole purpose is to share common state

```go
// speaker provide a common behavior for all concrete types to follow if they want to be a part of this group. 
// This is a contract for these concrete types to follow.
type Speaker interface {
    Speak()
}

// dog type contains everything it needs
type Dog struct {
    Name string
    IsMammal bool
    PackFactor int
}

// speak knows how to speak like a dog
// this makes a dog part of a group of concrete types
func (d *Dog) Speak() {
    fmt.Printf("Woof! My name is %s, it is %t, I am a mammal with a pack factor of %d.\n", 
    d.Name, 
    d.IsMammal, 
    d.PackFactor,
    )
}


type Cat struct {
    Name string
    IsMammal bool
    ClimbFactor int
}

func (c *Cat) Speak() {
    fmt.Printf("Meow! My name is %s, it is %t, I am a mammal with a climb factor of %d.\n", 
    c.Name, 
    c.IsMammal, 
    c.ClimbFactor,
    )
}

// create a list of animals that know how to speak
speakers := []Speaker{
    &Dog{
        Name: "Fido",
        IsMammal: true,
        PackFactor: 5,
    },
    &Cat{
        Name: "Milo",
        IsMammal: true,
        ClimbFactor: 4,
    },
}

for _, speaker := range speakers {
    speaker.Speak()
}

```
