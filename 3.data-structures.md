# Data Structures

Prefetcher is a caching mechanism that tries to figure out what data is needed in advance and prefetch it. By creating a predictable data access pattern, we can help the prefetcher to work more efficiently. The prefetcher brings in 64 bytes at a type regardless of the size of the actual data being read. Therefore, array - data structure that stores data contiguously in memory - helps the prefetcher to be more efficient in caching the relevant data.

TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer cache) is the caching system that converts virtual memory addresses to physical addresses in RAM. If the data requested is not found on the TLB, it further adds on to the latency and slows down the program.
There should be some consistency in which semantics to use when working with data. When working with the built-in data types (numbers, strings, and bools), use the value semantics to move them around.

## Array

```go
var fruits [5]string
// String is a two-word data structure and each word is 4 bytes in size.
fruits[0] = "Apple"
fruits[1] = "Orange"
fruits[2] = "Banana"
fruits[3] = "Grape"
fruits[4] = "Plum"

// this loop is a value semantics where we're creating our own copy of each fruit string
// but the copied string would still have the same backing array (each string is stored as array) on the heap
// so, we gain efficiency when duplicating the string because Go uses the pointer semantics behind the scene to just copy the pointer without duplicating the underlying data
for i, fruit := range fruits {
    // print function also gets its own copy of the string, but still pointing to the same array
    fmt.Println(i, fruit)
}

// the equivalent, but pointer/reference semantics would be the following
for i := range fruits {
    fmt.Println(fruits[i])
}
```
