# Data Structures

Prefetcher is a caching mechanism that tries to figure out what data is needed in advance and prefetch it. By creating a predictable data access pattern, we can help the prefetcher to work more efficiently. The prefetcher brings in 64 bytes at a type regardless of the size of the actual data being read. Therefore, array - data structure that stores data contiguously in memory - helps the prefetcher to be more efficient in caching the relevant data.

TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer cache) is the caching system that converts virtual memory addresses to physical addresses in RAM. If the data requested is not found on the TLB, it further adds on to the latency and slows down the program.
There should be some consistency in which semantics to use when working with data. When working with the reference types (arrays, slices etc.) and built-in data types (numbers, strings, and bools), use the value semantics to move them around.

## Array

```go
var fruits [5]string
// String is a two-word data structure and each word is 4 bytes in size.
fruits[0] = "Apple"
fruits[1] = "Orange"
fruits[2] = "Banana"
fruits[3] = "Grape"
fruits[4] = "Plum"

// this loop is a value semantics where we're creating our own copy of the array to assign fruit its value
for i, fruit := range fruits {
    // here we're modifying the original array; so fruits[1] which was initially "Orange" now becomes "Seabuckthorn"
    fruits[1] = "Seabuckthorn"
    if i == 1 {
        // fruit is the copy of the value at the first index of the copied array of fruits
        // so, the copied arrays first index is still storing "Orange" currently
        fmt.Printf("%s\n", fruit) // Orange
        // but if we check the original array's first index, it's now "Seabuckthorn
        fmt.Printf("%s\n", fruits[1])
    }
}

// let's check again
// The original array is indeed modified
fmt.Printf("%s\n", fruits[1]) // Seabuckthorn

// the equivalent, but pointer/reference semantics would be the following
for i := range fruits {
    fruits[1] = "Kiwi"
    if i == 1 {
        fmt.Printf("%s\n", fruits[i]) // Kiwi
    }
}
```

## Slices

Slice is the most important data structure in Go as it provides mechanical sympathy like array but is also dynamic in nature. It's a three-word data structure. First word points to the array, and the second word holds the length, while the third word contains the capacity (total number of available spots).
You have to be very careful with read and write operations on the copies of reference types such as slices because Go uses reference semantics in those operations. If you're working with the copy of a slice, that copy only holds the copy of the pointer to the original slice.

```go
    // make a slice with a length of 5 elements and a capacity of 8
    fruits := make([]string, 5, 8)
    fruits[0] = "Apple"
    fruits[1] = "Orange"
    fruits[2] = "Banana"
    fruits[3] = "Grape"
    fruits[4] = "Plum"

    fmt.Printf("%s", fruits[5]) // panic: runtime error: index out of range [5] with length 5
```

An empty slice and the absence of a slice (nil slice) are represented differently as follows:

```go
    // empty slice has a pointer pointing at the empty struct
    emptySlice := []string{}

    // empty struct is a zero allocation type and it's embedded into the runtime
    // you can think of the empty struct almost as a global variable that has one address
    // all the empty structs would be pointing to that address
    emptyStruct = struct{}{} 
    //you can also declare it as follows: 
    var emptyStruct1 struct{}

    // nil slice of strings (meaning there's no pointer in this slice data structure currently)
    var nilSlice []string
    // when you call append on a nil slice, the append function gets its own copy of the slice data structure (3-word: 1. pointer; 2. length; 3. capacity)
    // it checks the length and the capacity of the slice which are both zero currently,
    // and creates a new slice with the appended element and returns the slice
    // this is called the value semantic mutation api and it's the safest way to mutate built-in types & reference types
    nilSlice = append(nilSlice, "Hello")

    // when append is called the second time, it checks the length and the capacity again, and if they're equal
    // it creates a new slice with the capacity twice as big and includes the original elements plus the appended element and returns the slice
    nilSlice = append(nilSlice, "Second Hello")

    // the following code may create MEMORY LEAK because nilSlice is still holding the pointer to previous array we might not need later
    anotherSlice = append(nilSlice, "Third Hello")

    // if you know the size of the slice, state that with the capacity up front and append the values to it more efficiently
    slice100kCap := make([]string, 0, 1e5)

    // or you can create a slice with the desired length and directly access each element with its index to update it
    slice100kLength := make([]string, 1e5)
```

You can create a slice of slice as follows:

```go
    fruits := make([]string, 5, 8)

    fruits[0] = "Apple"
    fruits[1] = "Banana"
    fruits[2] = "Plum"
    fruits[3] = "Orange"
    fruits[4] = "Grape"

    fmt.Printf("Length: %d, Capacity: %d, Slice: %v\n", len(fruits), cap(fruits), fruits) // Length: 5, Capacity: 8, Slice: [Apple Banana Plum Orange Grape]

    // here we create another slice from the fruits slice, but actually it would point to the same backing array starting from the 2nd index
    // it would have the length of two as the element at the 4th index is not included
    // and the capacity would be 6 as the first two elements (0, 1) are excluded
    fruits_slice := fruits[2:4]
    fmt.Printf("Length: %d, Capacity: %d, Slice: %v\n", len(fruits_slice), cap(fruits_slice), fruits_slice) // Length: 2, Capacity: 6, Slice: [Plum Orange]

    // fruits_slice's first element is the third element of the fruits
    // if we update it, the third element of fruits would also be updated
    fruits_slice[0] = "CHERRY"
    fmt.Printf("Slice: %v\n", fruits) // Slice: [Apple Banana CHERRY Orange Grape]

    // if we append another element to fruits_slice, it replaces the element at the 4th index in the fruits (Grape is now no longer there)
    fruits_slice = append(fruits_slice, "ANOTHER_BERRY")
    fmt.Printf("Slice: %v\n", fruits) // Slice: [Apple Banana CHERRY Orange ANOTHER_BERRY]

    // to prevent from this issue, you can specify the capacity of the slice of the original slice and make it equal to its length
    fruits_slice2 := fruits[2:4:4]
    // now if you try to append to the new slice, it copies the sliced part of the original array and creates a new array with the copied elements plus the appended element
    fruits_slice2 = append(fruits_slice2, "CHANGED")
    // now the original array is unmodified
    fmt.Printf("Slice: %v\n", fruits) // Slice: [Apple Banana CHERRY Orange ANOTHER_BERRY]
    // and the update was performed on the copied array
    fmt.Printf("Slice: %v\n", fruits_slice2) // Slice: [CHERRY Orange CHANGED]
```

## String Slices

Go source code is always UTF-8. A string holds arbitrary bytes.
A string literal, absent byte-level escapes, always holds valid UTF-8 sequence. Those sequences represent Unicode code points called runes.
No guarantee is made in Go that characters in strings are normalized.

```go
// Multiple runes can represent different characters.
// In general, a character may be represented by a number of different sequence of code points (runes), and therefore, different sequences of UTF-8 bytes.

import (
    "fmt"
    "unicode/utf8"
)

// Declare a string with both korean and english characters
sentence := "세계 means world"

//UTFMax is 4 -- up to 4 bytes can be included per encoded rune.
var arr [utf8.UTFMax]byte

// Iterate over the sentence using the value semantics
for startIndex, sRune := range sentence {
    // capture the number of byes for this rune
    runeLength := utf8.RuneLen(sRune)

    // calculate the end index to slice the bytes associated with this rune
    endIndex := startIndex + runeLength

    // copy function can be used only on slices; any array, including string which is a data structure that uses a backing array, can be turned into a slice
    // copy the rune from the string to the array
    copy(arr[:], sentence[startIndex:endIndex])

    // display the details
    fmt.Printf("%2d: %q; codepoint: %#6x; encoded bytes: %#v\n", startIndex, sRune, sRune, arr[:runeLength])
}

// output of the code:
// 0: '세'; codepoint: 0xc138; encoded bytes: []byte{0xec, 0x84, 0xb8}
// 3: '계'; codepoint: 0xacc4; encoded bytes: []byte{0xea, 0xb3, 0x84}
// 6: ' '; codepoint:   0x20; encoded bytes: []byte{0x20}
// 7: 'm'; codepoint:   0x6d; encoded bytes: []byte{0x6d}
// 8: 'e'; codepoint:   0x65; encoded bytes: []byte{0x65}
// 9: 'a'; codepoint:   0x61; encoded bytes: []byte{0x61}
// 10: 'n'; codepoint:   0x6e; encoded bytes: []byte{0x6e}
// 11: 's'; codepoint:   0x73; encoded bytes: []byte{0x73}
// 12: ' '; codepoint:   0x20; encoded bytes: []byte{0x20}
// 13: 'w'; codepoint:   0x77; encoded bytes: []byte{0x77}
// 14: 'o'; codepoint:   0x6f; encoded bytes: []byte{0x6f}
// 15: 'r'; codepoint:   0x72; encoded bytes: []byte{0x72}
// 16: 'l'; codepoint:   0x6c; encoded bytes: []byte{0x6c}
// 17: 'd'; codepoint:   0x64; encoded bytes: []byte{0x64}

```

## Maps

```go
type user struct {
    name    string
    surname string
}

// you can't create a map using its zero value because you'll have problems when trying to read and write on that map
// so, you have to use make function to create a map
users := make(map[string]user)

users["Roy"] = user{"Rob", "Roy"}
users["Ford"] = user{"Henry", "Ford"}
users["Mouse"] = user{"Mickey", "Mouse"}
users["Jackson"] = user{"Micheal", "Jackson"}

// Read value at a specific key
mouse := users["Mouse"]
fmt.Printf("%#+v\n", mouse) // main.user{name:"Mickey", surname:"Mouse"}

// Replace value at the mouse key
users["Mouse"] = user{"Jerry", "Mouse"}
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", users["Mouse"]) // {name:Jerry surname:Mouse}

// Delete the value at a specific key
delete(users, "Roy") 

// Check the length of the map
fmt.Println(len(users)) // 3

// It's safe to delete an absent key
delete(users, "Roy") // 3
```

In Golang, if we readan absent key, we get the zero-value for this map's value type. This helps us to avoid writing defensive code in case the key doesn't exist.

```go
// create a map of scores for players
scores := make(map[string]int)

// read the absent element
score := scores["anna"]
// the zero value for int is 0
fmt.Println("Score: ", score) // Score:  0

// if we need to check for the presence of a key, we use a 2 variable assignment
// the second value is a boolean that indicates the presence.
score, isKeyPresent := scores["anna"]
fmt.Println("Score: ", score, "Present: ", isKeyPresent) // Score:  0 Present:  false

// when we increment at the absent key, this key is created and increment starts from zero
scores["anna"]++
// create new variables to store the score at "anna" key, and check if the key exists
newScore, isThisKeyPresent := scores["anna"]

// the previous variables still holds their original values 
fmt.Println("Score: ", score, "Present: ", isKeyPresent) // Score:  0 Present:  false
// new variables show the current state of the map
fmt.Println("Score: ", newScore, "Present: ", isThisKeyPresent) // Score:  1 Present:  true
```

In Go, you can only use data structures than can be used in conditionals. If you can't use something with an if statement, it can't be a key.
Also, there's no guaranteed order when you loop over maps in Go unless you sort the keys.
